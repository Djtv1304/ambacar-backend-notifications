"""
Django signals for notifications app.
"""
# Signals can be added here for automatic actions like:
# - Sending notifications when certain model events occur
# - Updating analytics when logs change
# - Syncing data with external systems

# Example:
# from django.db.models.signals import post_save
# from django.dispatch import receiver
# from .models import NotificationLog
#
# @receiver(post_save, sender=NotificationLog)
# def log_saved(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
#     if created:
#         # Do something when a new log is created
#         pass
